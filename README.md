# Golden Rose App - in process

### On search page type "CAKE" || "DONUTS" || "CHOCOLATE"

React/Redux/SASS

Used the same API as for MealMaker

Halfway completed, but the most important features are implemented:

Items are searchable, menu is created dynamically, items can be added to cart and liked, page switcher implemented.

+ Ingredients not working on cart page, as ingredietns from API are not structured as I want them to be, so added random markup.

Still to do: payment page and fix some design issues on search page.
